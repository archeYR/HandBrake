# HandBrake-w81 [![Windows Build](https://github.com/archeYR/HandBrake-w81/workflows/Windows%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/archeYR/HandBrake-w81/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+Build%22)


This is just a fork of [HandBrake](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake), which is **not** locked out from installing on Windows older than 10 (or for some users - Windows at all).  This is only tested and maintained on Windows 8.1, and as of now there is nothing that prevents HandBrake from running on there, other than the artificial lock. Some features work only on Windows 10 or later, however.

You might download the latest build from [Github artifacts](https://github.com/archeYR/HandBrake-w81/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Windows+Build%22)
